#OBJECT DETECTION USING OPENCV 

#I have 3 object with me 1> red 2> green 3> blue

'''How can we detect which color it is and how can way say to the computer only 1 specific color
that is what we are going to see using opencv'''

import cv2 # package of AI 

import numpy as np

#Lets capture the camera. 0 for webcam. if you want other webcam then we can change to index to 1, 2 
cap = cv2.VideoCapture(0) 

#Lets load the frame 
while True:
    _, frame = cap.read() 
    
    
#we convert this format to hsv , bgr library this is color format red, green, blue, we are frame with hsv which use to select the color

    hsv_frame = cv2.cvtColor(frame, cv2.COLOR_BGR2HSV)
    
# Lets frame on the windows   
    cv2.imshow("Frame", frame) 
    
# weight key event which is 1 and which is 27 then break the loop that means we are going to stop the loop
    key = cv2.waitKey(1)
    if key ==27:
        break

# Lets run this one and we will see the camera, camera is on 

# Now lets deeper understanding how to detect color now 

''' HSV --> HUE - we can see the color red,green,blue,yellow and also we can see the gradiation of the color         
          SATURATION - How much quantity of the color we want to have 
          (0- nothing, completely white, opencv - maximux pixel 0-255)
          VALUE - Brightness of the color (0- completely black)'''
#===========          
#Next step is to convert the color format to hsv
